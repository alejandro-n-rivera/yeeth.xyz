Hello! This is a site where we will publish findings we obtain with our tool, Yeeth!
Yeeth is a static analysis tool we have running on a remote server that will print out findings through a Discord bot

```python
def cool()
  print("Can I use it?")

cool()
```
Not yet, we want to flesh out the bugs as they come and want a stable version first. Once that is done, we should have enough findings to prove that what we have works. Till then, feel free to browse the site and look at our findings!
